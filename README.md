**If you want to contribute, follow these steps**

1. Create a GitHub account
2. Login and fork the central repo
3. Clone this repo to your computer -> You now have an offline copy of your online fork
4. Changes done to your offline repo don't get synced to your online repo automatically. To sync them, do this:
  * Change things
  * "Commit" those changes to your local repo (with a short and descriptive commit message)
  * "Push" to your online repo
5. The changes are now online and visible to everyone but they are not in the central repository yet. If you want to have them merged into the central repo, start a pull request on your fork's website.


GitHub has a tool for Windows that eases these steps. For a basic understanding of git see this guide https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/. Don't be put off by the commands, if you use the GitHub tool you won't need them.
